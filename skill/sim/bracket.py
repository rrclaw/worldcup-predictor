"""Deterministic 'most-likely' knockout projection — the modal bracket (出线树).

A single-path point projection used for the dashboard's elimination tree:

  1. each group is resolved to a winner / runner-up / third by the model's
     expected round-robin points (3·P(win) + 1·P(draw), neutral venue);
  2. the 8 best third-placed teams (by expected points) are slotted into the
     official 2026 R32 bracket via the same eligibility map the Monte Carlo uses;
  3. every knockout tie is won by the side with the higher model win-probability
     (draws split 50/50, since knockouts can't end level), climbing R32 → champion.

This is a *point projection*, not the Monte Carlo title odds. The champion here is
the single most-likely path; `title_probability` (which integrates over every
possible path and upset) stays the headline number — the two can legitimately
differ, and the dashboard shows both.
