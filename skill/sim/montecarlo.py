"""Vectorised Monte Carlo tournament simulation for WC2026.

Group stage uses the real fixture list (reconstructed group structure). Knockout
is a single-elimination bracket among the 32 advancers. Everything is vectorised
across `n` simulations with numpy, so 50k runs take a couple of seconds.

Scorelines are sampled from the Dixon-Coles expected goals (independent Poisson;
the DC low-score correction is a likelihood term, negligible for sampling). Knockout
draws are resolved by a strength-weighted penalty coin flip.

Note: the knockout bracket is randomised per simulation rather than using FIFA's
exact slot mapping for the 8 best third-placed teams — a reasonable v1 approximation
for title probabilities. Encoding the official R32 slotting is a future refinement.
