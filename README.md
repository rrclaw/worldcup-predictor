# worldcup-predictor

Per-match probability predictions for the 2026 FIFA World Cup with daily live
re-forecasting, automated bet-slate generation, and a public dashboard.

**Philosophy — market-anchored ensemble.** Bookmaker consensus is hard to
beat over the long run, but blindly copying odds has no edge. We anchor on
de-vigged market consensus as a strong prior, then layer Dixon-Coles, ELO
priors, and contextual adjustments — and surface where the model *disagrees*
with the market as the interesting signal. Per-market walk-forward
validation gates every factor before it can carry stakes.

## What it does

- **Per match:** 1X2 + Asian Handicap + Over/Under + full scoreline distribution
- **Tournament:** Monte Carlo (≥50k runs) → group / round / title probabilities
- **Live:** daily refresh of odds, lineups, weather; realised RPS / Brier tracked
- **Bet slate:** `cli bet` drafts a Quarter-Kelly stake-sized recommendation
  list across AH + OU lines (default `--mode ahou`, mirroring mainstream
  Asian-book layout 输赢盘 / 让球盘 / 大小盘), with per-market walk-forward
  acceptance enforced
